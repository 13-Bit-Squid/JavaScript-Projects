# Pizza Menu
This project is a menu used to order and create your own personalized pizza with varying sizes, and toppings! After you're all through it even calculates the total for your order as well!

# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This variant is an EXREME version of traditional Tic-Tac-Toe, the only thing really that makes it "EXTREME" is the sound effects, otherwise it's really just Tic-Tac-Toe.

# Calculator
HAVE YOU EVER NEEDED A CALCULATOR IN YOUR BROWSER THAT DOES BASIC ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION, AND DIVISION FOR YOU?? WELL I SURE HAVE THE CALCULATOR FOR YOU RIGHT HERE!
