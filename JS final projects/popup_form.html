        <p>According to all known laws<br>
            of aviation,<br>
            <hr>
              
            there is no way a bee<br>
            should be able to fly.<br>
            <br>
              
            Its wings are too small to get<br>
            its fat little body off the ground.<br>
            <br>
              
            The bee, of course, flies anyway<br>
            <br>
              
            because bees don't care<br>
            what humans think is impossible.<br>
            <br>
              
            Yellow, black. Yellow, black.<br>
            Yellow, black. Yellow, black.<br>
            <br>
              
            Ooh, black and yellow!<br>
            Let's shake it up a little.<br>
            <br>
              
            Barry! Breakfast is ready!<br>
            <br>
              
            Ooming!<br>
            <br>
              
            Hang on a second.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
              
            Looking sharp.<br>
            <br>
              
            Use the stairs. Your father<br>
            paid good money for those.<br>
            <br>
              
            Sorry. I'm excited.<br>

            <br>
              
            Very proud.<br>
            <br>
              
            Ma! I got a thing going here.<br>
            <br>
              
            - You got lint on your fuzz.<br>
            - Ow! That's me!<br>
            <br>
              
            - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.<br>
            - Bye!<br>
            <br>
              
            Barry, I told you,<br>
            stop flying in the house!<br>
            <br>
              
            - Hey, Adam.<br>
            - Hey, Barry.<br>
            <br>
              
            - Is that fuzz gel?<br>
            - A little. Special day, graduation.<br>
            <br>
              
            Never thought I'd make it.<br>
            <br>
              
            Three days grade school,<br>
            three days high school.<br>
            <br>
              
            Those were awkward.<br></p>
